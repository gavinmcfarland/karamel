## TODO

- Move `mole.config.js` and theme into `scr/` (need to update `mole` to accept different path for config file)
- Complete the following parts
  - `border` 
  - `max-width` DONE
  - `width` DONE
  - `height` DONE
  - `margin` DONE
  - `padding` DONE
  - `line-height`
  - `letter-spacing`
  - `flex`
  - `color theme` DONE
  - `font size` DONE
- Create or use a plugin to apply parts to css
- Move parts/property definitions to separate file from theme
- Separate files into `karamel` (index.css), `karamel/typography`, `karamel/reset`, `karamel/functions`.
- Test custom config from another package (app might have to be moved into a postcss plugin)
- Consider moving logic for creating parts into PostCSS styles (using mole to output json or js object which is imported by PostCSS)
- Fix bug when styles are build and utilities file is empty. Think it has something to do with mole.build() not being done before postCSS starts parsing
